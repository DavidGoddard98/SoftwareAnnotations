# UML State Machines as Annotations for State-based Software
A dissertation project contributing to my BSc degree at The University of Sheffield. It outlines the design and implementation of a plugin for the Eclipse IDE which extends a well known tool called PlantUML, enhancing its ability to annotate state-based software.

*The plugin is writen 100% in Java*.

# Introduction

The goal behind the plugin made in this project is to simplyify the complexities developers face when attempting to understand state-based code, whether their aim is to extend it, write tests for it, or simply adapt it. Within the confinements of this project this has been accomplished in a variety of ways:

* Linking between components in a diagram and lines of code (and vice versa) via navigation (see below).
* Automatic generation of a state-machine diagram based on state-based code. 

Below, an overview of the results and uses of the plugin will be illustrated. For a substantially more detailed examination that stretches from research into exisiting tools, all the way to the design and implementation of the plugin, see the attached thesis (*****).
