# UML State Machines as Annotations for State-based Software
A dissertation project contributing to my BSc degree at The University of Sheffield. It outlines the design and implementation of a plugin for the Eclipse IDE which extends a well known tool called PlantUML https://plantuml.com/, enhancing its ability to annotate state-based software.

*The plugin is writen 100% in Java*.

# Introduction

The goal behind the plugin made in this project is to simplyify the complexities developers face when attempting to understand state-based code, whether their aim is to extend it, write tests for it, or simply adapt it. Within the confinements of this project this has been accomplished in a variety of ways:

* Automatic generation of a state-machine diagram based on state-based code. 
* Linking between components in a diagram and lines of code (and vice versa) via navigation (see below).

Below, an overview of the results and uses of the plugin will be illustrated. For a substantially more detailed examination that stretches from research into exisiting tools, all the way to the design and implementation of the plugin, see the attached thesis 'Annotations_of_Software.pdf'.

# The plugin

Undeniably, the most useful feature of the plugin is the automatic generation of a state machine diagram when given state-based code. The generated diagram appears in a view within Eclipse next to the text editor for the users convenience:

<br>
<div align = "center">
  <img src="images/eclipsevie.PNG" width="750"/>
</div>
<br>

As shown, this provides the developer with an easy way to comprehend the code they are writing/reading within the same environment.

As can be seen in the figure above, state declerations must be prefaced with 'valid_states'. *It should be noted that this is the only requirement the user must satisfy within their code to enable the diagrammatic generation to occur.* 

Perhaps of further interest is the split from State2 which either goes to State3 or to exit. Without going into too much of the theory (see the PDF attached for more), this occurs due to the if statement, which acts as a guard for State3's behaviour. If the conditional is met (in this case if the wind speed is above 50), then the systems behaviour is now encapsulated by State3, otherwise the system goes to the exit state.  

I'm sure you're thinking - what if some of this hypothetical systems behaviour is guarded behind a plethora of nested conditionals? Utilizing a tree structure and a fairly complex algorithm for traversal, the plugin is able to autonomously generate a diagram which accurately depicts the logic:




An aspect that stood out to me when reading state-based code when designing this plugin was that it can be difficult to relate components of a state-machine to the aspects of the software it illustrates. This prompted me to implement a feature that constructs links between the two via navigating the user between them in the hope that this would improve clarity. The results of this were more beneficial than anticipated. 

# Installation

PlantUML for Eclipse must be installed - http://hallvard.github.io/plantuml/

This plugin also requires GraphViz to be installed, you can install this here - https://graphviz.org/download/. You must then link the dot executable to Eclipse via the PlantUML preference page. 

Then simply install my plugin - statemachine.generation.site

To generate a diagram you must insert the state-based code between the following statements:

@start_OSM_generation
//Insert code here
@end_OSM_generation

Then, if the PlantUML view is open in Eclispe, a diagram will be automatically generated for you.
